# Guides

## Frontend Style Guide

This [frontend style guide](https://github.com/reearth/guides/blob/main/frontend/style.md) helps to keep [Re:Earth](https://github.com/reearth/reearth), [Re:Earth CMS](https://github.com/reearth/reearth-cms) and any internal Re:Earth repositories' code consistent. This is in hope that any community member or core member can work across repositories freely with few headaches.
